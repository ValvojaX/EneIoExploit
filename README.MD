# Ene

## Description

This is a demonstration of vulnerabilities in ene.sys driver, which is used by ASRock Polychrome RGB software V1.0.95. By my knowledge, the same driver is used by other vendors as well. The newer versions of the software use MsIo32.sys and MsIo64.sys drivers, which are very similar to ene.sys and also exploitable. The Polychrome RGB software V1.0.95 is downloadable from [here](https://download.asrock.com/Utility/RGB/PolychromeRGB(v1.0.60).zip).
